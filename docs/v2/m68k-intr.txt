Exception Processing:
    * normal / halt / exception
    * HALT - bus error within bus error exception
    * STOP, RESET, modify the SR, move to USP, move from USP.
    * U to S mode - Only through exception. S to U mode - RTE, MOVE to SR, 
      ANDI to SR, EORI to SR
    * source of exceptions - external (reset, bus error, interrupts)
      internal (instructions (TRAP, TRAPV, CHK, DIV), address errors, tracing)
    * All exception vectors are 2 words (4 bytes) except RESET, which is 4 words
    * RESET in supervisor program space. Others in supervisor data space.
    * vector numbers are generated externally or internally. for interrupts 
      a peripheral provides the vector number during the interrupt acknowledge 
      cycle.

RESET                       Ext.
BUS ERROR (access fault)    Ext.
ADDRESS ERROR               Ext.
