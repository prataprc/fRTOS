Here we assusme the following 
	- DSP is running at 30 MHz.
        - each instruction consumes one cycle in one instruction.

All the following timing calculations are for worst case scenario.

1. The calculation of the CD Input speed:

1.1 The CD Speed:
	At 1x The CD is suppose to give a typical data o/p of 
	150 KBps.
		75 sectors in one second.
	Minimum - 50 sectors/sec (assump.)
	Maximum - 100 sectors/sec(assump.)	

	So 1 SECTOR RECIVED FOR EVERY 10 ms (at maximum throughput).

1.2 Audio In Mail Box:
	An interrupt is generated when the FIFO has 8*24 bits of data.
	So for 1 sector there are 98 frames (each of 24 bytes).
	For every 10ms the ISR shall be called at 100 times.

	So we have an interrput for every 100 us.
	or the ISR is called 10000 times in one second.
	So we can execute 3000 instructions in that gap.
	

2. Audio-Out Mail Box:
	On the DAC side the FIFO is read at 88.2 KHz and 21 words are read 
	at a time. 

	So to empty the FIFO it takes 230 us.
	or the ISR is called 4200 times in one second.	

	So we can execute 6900 instructions in that gap.

	
3. Timer interrupt:
	We shall make the timer interrupt 1000 times in one second.
	So we have 1000 us between two interrupts.

	So we can execute 30000 instructions in that gap.	

4. C3 Mail Box:
	We shall assume that the MP3 Application in DSP2 takes a maximum 
	of 30 sectors in 1 second (60 KBytes/second).

	So the ISR will be called 1280 times per second.
		(30 * 2048) / (16 * 3)
	An interrupt will be generated for the DSP2 immediately after the 
	C3 mailbox is filled. If the ISR on the DSP2 takes 200 cycles to empty 
	the C3 mailbox, the DSP1 will interrupted after 200 cycles.

	So the interrupt accors in burst.
	And we have app. 3 to 4 uS between two interrupts.
	And we will have 42 interrupts like that in burst.

5. SRC Mail Box:
	The ISR shall be called about 2800 times / second
		(88200 * 3) / (32 * 3) 

	See 4.

6. uC Mail Box:
	This ISR will be relatively very few times.
	So the time taken by this ISR is negligible.

NOTE:
	Make sure that there is not big contention between interrupts.

IMPORTANT: 
	These calculations are only theoretical. We should check them
in the actual board.

So if we take some 150 instructions for each ISRs then
the following is the MIPS calculation for for each of them.

AIN-Mail Box  : 10000 * 150 = 1500000 = 1.5  MIPS.
AOUT-Mail Box :  4200 * 150 =  630000 = 0.6  MIPS.
Timer	      :  1000 * 150 =  150000 = 0.15 MIPS.
C3 Mail Box   :  2200 * 150 =  330000 = 0.33 MIPS.
SRC Mail Box  :  2800 * 150 =  420000 = 0.42 MIPS.

Total Time = 3 MIPS.
